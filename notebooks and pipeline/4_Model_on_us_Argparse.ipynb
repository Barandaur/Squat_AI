Tracing is expensive and the excessive number of tracings could be due to (1) creating @tf.function repeatedly in a loop, (2) passing tensors with different shapes, (3) passing Python objects instead of tensors. For (1), please define your @tf.function outside of the loop. For (2), @tf.function has experimental_relax_shapes=True option that relaxes argument shapes that can avoid unnecessary retracing. For (3), please refer to https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/customization/performance#python_or_tensor_args and https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/function for  more details.\n","                  precision    recall  f1-score   support\n","\n","  bad_back_round       0.32      0.73      0.44        11\n","   bad_back_warp       0.60      0.55      0.57        11\n","        bad_head       0.40      0.25      0.31         8\n","bad_innner_thigh       1.00      0.38      0.55         8\n","     bad_shallow       0.67      0.25      0.36         8\n","         bad_toe       0.33      0.30      0.32        10\n","            good       0.40      0.44      0.42         9\n","\n","        accuracy                           0.43        65\n","       macro avg       0.53      0.41      0.42        65\n","    weighted avg       0.52      0.43      0.43        65\n","\n"],"name":"stdout"}]}]}
